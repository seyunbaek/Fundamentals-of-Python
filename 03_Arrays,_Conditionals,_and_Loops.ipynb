    "# **Week 3: Arrays, Conditionals, and Loops**\n",
    "## What are Arrays?\n",
    "In simple words, array is a collection of data in any form or type. Arrays are useful when storing multiple items in a single variable. There are four main types of arrays that we will focus on: arrays, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Lists**\n",
    "Lists are one of the four built-in arrays in Python. It could be created using sqaure brackets: [ ]. Items in a list are ordered, changeable, and allows duplicate values. \n",
    "```\n",
    "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Properties\n",
    "When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items in the list have a defined order, and that order will not change. So, if you add a new item to the list, it will be added to the end of the list. The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.\n",
    "Since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value:\n",
    "```\n",
    "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"apple\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "print(fruits)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### List Length\n",
    "To determine the number of items in a list, use the ```len()``` function:\n",
    "```\n",
    "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "print(len(fruits))\n",
    "```\n",
    "This function could be used the same way for all types of arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Indexing\n",
    "List items are indexed. For example, the first item in the list has index ```[0]```, the second item in the list has index ```[1]```,  etc. Moreover, negative numbers could be used for index to refer to items counting from the end to start. For example, index ```[-1]``` refers to the last item, index ```[-2]``` refers to the second last item, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Range of Indexes\n",
    "You can specify a range of indexes by specifying where to start and where to end the range.\n",
    "\n",
    "When specifying a range, the return value will be a new list with the specified items. A range includes the starting index, but does not include the ending index. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following code returns the third, fourth, and fifth item:\n",
    "```\n",
    "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"orange\", \"kiwi\", \"melon\", \"mango\"]\n",
    "print(fruits[2:5])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Change List Items\n",
    "To change the value of a specific item, refer to the index number:\n",
    "```\n",
    "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"apple\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "fruits[1] = \"blueberry\"\n",
    "print(fruits)\n",
    "```\n",
    "To change the value of items within a certain range, define a list with the new values, and refer to the range of index numbers where you want to insert the new values:\n",
    "```\n",
    "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"apple\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "fruits[1:3] = [\"blueberry\", \"orange\"]\n",
    "print(fruits)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **List Methods**\n",
    "Python has a set of built-in methods that you can use on lists. For using a method, the list name should be at front, followed by a period or full stop, and the method you want to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Method | Description | Example |\n",
    "| ------- | ----------- | ------- |\n",
    "| append() | Adds an element at the end of the list | ```list.append(\"x\")``` |\n",
    "| clear() | Removes all the elements from the list | ```list.clear()``` |\n",
    "| copy() | Returns a copy of the list | ```list.copy()``` |\n",
    "| count() | Returns the number of elements with the specified value | ```list.count()``` |\n",
    "| extend() | Add the elements of a list (or any iterable), to the end of the current list | ```list.extend(x,y,z)```\n",
    "| index() | Returns the index of the first element with the specified value | ``` list.index(\"apple\")``` |\n",
    "| insert() | Adds an element at the specified position | ```list.insert(0, \"pineapple\")``` |\n",
    "| pop() | Removes the element at the specified position | ```list.pop(2)``` |\n",
    "| remove() | Removes the item with the specified value | ```list.remove(\"banana\")``` |\n",
    "| reverse() | Reverses the order of the list | ```list.reverse()``` |\n",
    "| sort() | Sorts the list | ```list.sort()``` |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Tuples**\n",
    "A tuple is a collection which is ordered, **unchangeable**, and allows duplicates. Tuples are written with round brackets: ( )\n",
    "```\n",
    "cars = (\"BMW\", \"Mercedes-Benz\", \"Audi\")\n",
    "print(cars)\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Properties\n",
    "Tuples have mostly the same properties as a list but the items assigned to a tuple is unchangeable. This means that we cannot change, add, or remove items from a tuple after it has been created. For the rest, tuples have the same way of finding the length, indexing, and range of indexes as a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Update Tuples\n",
    "Once a tuple is create, you cannot change its values, making them unchangeable or immutable. However, there is a way you could change its values: convert the tuple into a list, change the list, and convert the list back into a tuple. This could be shown in the code below:\n",
    "```\n",
    "x = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")\n",
    "y = list(x)\n",
    "y[1] = \"kiwi\"\n",
    "x = tuple(y)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This way, you could use all the list methods for changing it before you convert it back to a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unpack Tuples\n",
    "When we create a tuple, we normally assign values to it. This is called \"packing\" a tuple:\n",
    "```\n",
    "fruits = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "But, in Python, we are also allowed to extract the values back into variables. This is called \"unpacking\":\n",
    "```\n",
    "fruits = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")\n",
    "\n",
    "(green, yellow, red) = fruits\n",
    "\n",
    "print(green)\n",
    "print(yellow)\n",
    "print(red)\n",
    "```\n",
    "If the number of variables is less than the number of values, you can add an ```*```to the variable name and the values will be assigned to the variable as a list:\n",
    "```\n",
    "fruits = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"strawberry\", \"raspberry\")\n",
    "\n",
    "(green, yellow, *red) = fruits\n",
    "\n",
    "print(green)\n",
    "print(yellow)\n",
    "print(red)\n",
    "```\n",
    "If the asterisk is added to another variable name than the last, Python will assign values to the variable until the number of values left matches the number of variables left.\n",
    "```\n",
    "fruits = (\"apple\", \"mango\", \"papaya\", \"pineapple\", \"cherry\")\n",
    "\n",
    "(green, *tropic, red) = fruits\n",
    "\n",
    "print(green)\n",
    "print(tropic)\n",
    "print(red)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The tuple( ) constructor\n",
    "It is also possible to use the ```tuple()``` constructor to make a tuple.\n",
    "```\n",
    "thistuple = tuple((\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")) # note the double round-brackets\n",
    "print(thistuple)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tuple Methods\n",
    "| Method | Description | Example |\n",
    "| ------ | ----------- | ------- |\n",
    "| count() | Returns the number of times a specified value occurs in a tuple | ```tuple.count(\"apple\")``` |\n",
    "| index() | Searches the tuple for a specified value and returns the position of where it was found | ```tuple.index(\"banana\")``` |\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Sets**\n",
    "A set is a collection which is **unordered**, **unchangeable**, **unindexed**, and does not allow duplicates.\n",
    "* Although a set is unchangeable, you could still remove items and add new items.\n",
    "Sets are written with curly brackets: { }.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unordered\n",
    "Unordered means that the items in a set do not have a defined order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Set items can appear in a different order every time you use them, and cannot be referred to by index or key.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Duplicates not allowed\n",
    "Sets cannot have two items with the same value. Duplicate values will be ignored:\n",
    "```\n",
    "thisset = {\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"apple\"}\n",
    "print(thisset)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The set( ) constructor\n",
    "It is also possible to use the ```set()``` constructor to make a set, similar to the tuple() constructor.\n",
    "```\n",
    "thisset = set((\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")) # note the double round-brackets\n",
    "print(thisset)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Set Methods\n",
    "| Method | Description | Example |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| add() | Adds an element to the set | ```set.add(\"peach\")``` |\n",
    "| clear() | Removes all the elements from the set | ```set.clear()``` |\n",
    "| copy() | Returns a copy of the set | ```set.copy()``` |\n",
    "| difference() | Returns a set containing the difference between two or more sets | ```set1.difference(set2)``` |\n",
    "| difference_update() | Removes the items in this set that are also included in another, specified set | ```set1.difference_update(set2)``` |\n",
    "| discard() | Remove the specified item | ```set.discard(\"apple\")``` |\n",
    "| intersection() | Returns a set, that is the intersection of two other sets | ```set1.intersection(set2)``` |\n",
    "| intersection_update() | Removes the items in this set that are not present in other, specified set(s) | ```set1.intersection_update(set2)``` |\n",
    "| isdisjoint() | Returns whether two sets have a intersection or not | ```set1.isdisjoint(set2)``` |\n",
    "| issubset() | Returns whether another set contains this set or not | ```set1.issubset(set2)``` |\n",
    "| issuperset() | Returns whether this set contains another set or not | ```set1.issuperset(set2)``` |\n",
    "| pop() | Removes an element from the set | ```set.pop(3)``` |\n",
    "| remove() | Removes the specified element | ```set.remove(\"banana\")``` |\n",
    "| symmetric_difference() | Returns a set with the symmetric differences of two sets | ```set1.symmetric_difference(set2)``` |\n",
    "| symmetric_difference_update() | inserts the symmetric differences from this set and another | ```set1.symmetric_difference_update(set2)``` |\n",
    "| union() | Return a set containing the union of sets | ```set1.union(set2)``` |\n",
    "| update() | Update the set with the union of this set and others | ```set1.update(set2)``` |\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Dictionaries**\n",
    "Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "A dictionary is a collection which is ordered, changeable and do not allow duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are written with curly brackets: { }, and have keys and values:\n",
    "```\n",
    "thisdict = {\n",
    "  \"brand\": \"Ford\",\n",
    "  \"model\": \"Mustang\",\n",
    "  \"year\": 1964\n",
    "}\n",
    "print(thisdict)\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Access Items in a Dictionary\n",
    "You can access the items of a dictionary by referring to its key name, inside square brackets: [ ]. The following code is for getting the value of the \"model\" key:\n",
    "```\n",
    "thisdict = {\n",
    "  \"brand\": \"Ford\",\n",
    "  \"model\": \"Mustang\",\n",
    "  \"year\": 1964\n",
    "}\n",
    "x = thisdict[\"model\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Changing Items in a Dictionary\n",
    "Make a change in the original dictionary, and see that the values list gets updated as well:\n",
    "```\n",
    "car = {\n",
    "\"brand\": \"Ford\",\n",
    "\"model\": \"Mustang\",\n",
    "\"year\": 1964\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "x = car.values()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(x) #before the change\n",
    "\n",
    "car[\"year\"] = 2020\n",
    "\n",
    "print(x) #after the change\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Dictionary Methods\n",
    "| Method | Description | Example |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- | \n",
    "| clear() | Removes all the elements from the dictionary | ```dict.clear()``` | \n",
    "| copy() | Returns a copy of the dictionary | ```dict.copy()``` |\n",
    "| fromkeys() | Returns a dictionary with the specified keys and value | ```dict.fromkeys(key, 0)``` |\n",
    "| get() | Returns the value of the specified key | ```dict.get(\"brand\")``` | \n",

    "| values() | Returns a list of all the values in the dictionary | ```dict.values()``` |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are conditionals?\n",
    "\n",
    "Booleans are most useful when combined with conditional statements, using the keywords if, elif, and else.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional statements, often referred to as if-then statements, let you control what pieces of code are run based on the value of some Boolean condition. Here's an example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "  if x == 0:\n",
    "        print(x, \"is zero\")\n",
    "  elif x > 0:\n",
    "        print(x, \"is positive\")\n",
    "  elif x < 0:\n",
    "        print(x, \"is negative\")\n",
    "  else:\n",
    "        print(x, \"is unlike anything I've ever seen...\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| Operators | Description |\n",
    "| --------- | -------------- |\n",
    "| a == b | a equal to b |\n",
    "| a != b | a not equal to b |\n",
    "| a < b | a less than b |\n",
    "| a > b | a greater than b |\n",
    "| a <= b | a less than or equal to b |\n",
    "| a >= b | a greater than or equal to b |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indentation\n",
    "Python relies on indentation (whitespace at the beginning of a line) to define scope in the code. This could be used either by pressing the tab or four space bars. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "### If... Else...\n",
    "\n",
    "- If\n",
    "- Elif\n",
    "- Else\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "a = 200\n",
    "b = 33\n",
    "if b > a:\n",
    "  print(\"b is greater than a\")\n",
    "elif a == b:\n",
    "  print(\"a and b are equal\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "  print(\"a is greater than b\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Short Hand If\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have only one statement to execute, you can put it on the same line as the if statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if a > b: print(\"a is greater than b\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "a = 2\n",
    "b = 330\n",
    "print(\"A\") if a > b else print(\"B\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Nested If\n",
    "You can have if statements inside if statements, this is called **nested** if statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "x = 41\n",
    "\n",
    "if x > 10:\n",
    "  print(\"Above ten,\")\n",
    "  if x > 20:\n",
    "    print(\"and also above 20!\")\n",
    "  else:\n",
    "    print(\"but not above 20.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "### The Pass Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "If statements cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have an if statement with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "```\n",
    "a = 33\n",
    "b = 200\n",
    "\n",
    "if b > a:\n",
    "  pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are Loops?\n",
    "In computer programming, a loop is a sequence of instruction s that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached. Typically, a certain process is done, such as getting an item of data and changing it, and then some condition is checked such as whether a counter has reached a prescribed number.\n",
    "\n",
    "- While loops\n",
    "- For loops\n",
    "\n",
    "### **While Loops**\n",
    "\n",
    "With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Print i as long as i is less than 6:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "i = 1\n",
    "while i < 6:\n",
    "  print(i)\n",
    "  i += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Break Statement\n",
    "With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exit the loop when i is 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "i = 1\n",
    "while i < 6:\n",
    "  print(i)\n",
    "  if i == 3:\n",
    "    break\n",
    "  i += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### The Continue Statement\n",
    "With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Continue to the next iteration if i is 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "i = 0\n",
    "while i < 6:\n",
    "  i += 1 \n",
    "  if i == 3:\n",
    "    continue\n",
    "  print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Else Statement\n",
    "With the else statement we can run a block of code once when the condition no longer is true:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Print a message once the condition is false:\n",
    "```\n",
    "i = 1\n",
    "while i < 6:\n",
    "  print(i)\n",
    "  i += 1\n",
    "else:\n",
    "  print(\"i is no longer less than 6\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Iterating: repeating\n",
    "\n",
    "This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "for x in fruits:ㅁ\n",
    "\n",
    "  print(x)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*NOTES : The for loop does not require an indexing variable to set beforehand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Loop through the letters in the word \"banana\":\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "for x in \"banana\":\n",
    "\n",
    "  print(x)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "#### The break Statement\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "With the break statement we can stop the loop before it has looped through all the items:\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Exit the loop when x is \"banana\":\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "for x in fruits:\n",
    "\n",
    "  print(x) \n",
    "\n",
    "  if x == \"banana\":\n",
    "\n",
    "    break\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The continue Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration of the loop, and continue with the next:\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not print banana:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "for x in fruits:\n",
    "\n",
    "  if x == \"banana\":\n",
    "\n",
    "    continue\n",
    "\n",
    "  print(x)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "#### The range() Function\n",
    "\n",
    "To loop through a set of code a specified number of times, we can use the range() function,\n",
    "\n",
    "The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and ends at a specified number.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
