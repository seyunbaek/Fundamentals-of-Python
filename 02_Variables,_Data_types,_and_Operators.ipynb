    "# **Week 2: Variables, Data types, and Operators**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **What are comments?**\n",
    "Comments in Python are the lines of code that are **ignored by the computer** when executing the code. Comments could be used for explaining your code, making your code more readable, and prevent execution when testing the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a comment\n",
    "Comments start with a **#**, and Python will ignore it.\n",
    "```\n",
    "#This is a comment\n",
    "print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, Python will ignore the text \"This is a comment\" and only execute the print(\"Hello, World!\") function at the bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comments could be used after a line of code and Python will ignore anything after the #.\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(\"Hello, World\") #This is a comment\n",
    "```\n",
    "A comment does not have to explain the code, it could be used for python to prevent the code to execute.\n",
    "```\n",
    "#print(\"Good morning\")\n",
    "print(\"Good evening\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi Line comment\n",
    "To add a multi line comment, you could add a # before each of the seperate lines.\n",
    "```\n",
    "#This is a comment\n",
    "#written in\n",
    "#more than just one line\n",
    "print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Or, you could add \" \" \" (three double quotation marks) on the top and bottom of the comment without having to add #. For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "This is a comment\n",
    "written in\n",
    "more than just one line\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## **What are Variables?**\n",
    "In simple words, variables are containers for storing data values. Declaring a variable in Python is a lot simpler than in other languages. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it. For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "y = \"John\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, the value 5 is assigned to the variable x using the equals sign, and the value \"John\" is assigned to the varible y. As shown here, the equals sign is not used for showing that two values are equal like in math. Instead, it means that the value on the right side is **assigned** to the variable on the right in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable Names\n",
    "A variable in Python can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). There are a few basic rules that needs to be followed when naming variables:\n",
    "- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character\n",
    "- A variable name cannot start with a number\n",
    "- A variable name can only contain alphabets, numbers, and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _)\n",
    "- Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age, and AGE are three different variables)\n",
    "- Variable names cannot have a space in between\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "#Legal variable names:\n",
    "myvar = \"John\"\n",
    "my_var = \"John\"\n",
    "_my_var = \"John\"\n",
    "myVar = \"John\"\n",
    "MYVAR = \"John\"\n",
    "myvar2 = \"John\"\n",
    "#Illegal variable names:\n",
    "2myvar = \"John\"\n",
    "my-var = \"John\"\n",
    "my var = \"John\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Assign Multiple Values\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Many values to many variables\n",
    "You could assign values to multiple variables in one line:\n",
    "```\n",
    "x, y, z = \"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Cherry\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### One Value to Multiple Variables\n",
    "You could also assign the same value to multiple variables in one line:\n",
    "```\n",
    "x = y = z = \"Orange\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output Variables\n",
    "The print( ) function is often used to output variables.\n",
    "```\n",
    "x = \"Python is awesome\"\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the print( ) function, you output multiple variables in the same line, seperated by a comma:\n",
    "```\n",
    "x = \"Python\"\n",
    "y = \"is\"\n",
    "z = \"awesome\"\n",
    "print(x, y, z)\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can also use the + operator to output multiple variables:\n",
    "```\n",
    "x = \"Python \"\n",
    "y = \"is \"\n",
    "z = \"awesome\"\n",
    "print(x + y + z)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Also, the + character is used as a mathematical operator for numbers.\n",
    "```\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "y = 10\n",
    "print(x + y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "However, it is not suitable to combine different data types in the print ( ) function using the + operator. (This will give you an error)\n",
    "```\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "y = \"John\"\n",
    "print(x + y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Therefore, it is best to output multiple variables in the print( ) function seperated with commas, which could support different data types.\n",
    "```\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "y = \"John\"\n",
    "print(x, y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## **What are Data types?**\n",
    "Data types are simply a particular kind of data item which tells the computer how the programmer intends to use it. It could be defined by the values it can take, the programming language used, or the operators that can be performed on it. There are seven main types of data types in Python: text type, numeric types, sequence types, mapping type, set types, boolean type, and binary types. During this course, we will mainly learn about the text type, numeric types, and boolean type. \n",
    "\n",
    "| Data type | Name in Python |\n",
    "| --------- | -------------- |\n",
    "| Text | str |\n",
    "| Numeric | int, float, complex |\n",
    "| Sequence | list, tuple, range |\n",
    "| Mapping | dict |\n",
    "| Set | set, frozenset |\n",
    "| Boolean Type | bool |\n",
    "| Binary | bytes, bytearray, memoryview |\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the type of any object could be verified by using the type( ) funtion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Numeric Types**\n",
    "There are three numeric types in Python:\n",
    " - int\n",
    " - float\n",
    " - complex\n",
    "\n",
    "#### int\n",
    "Int, or integer, is a positive or negative whole number without decimals that could have unlimited lenth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integers:\n",
    "```\n",
    "x = 3\n",
    "y = -17\n",
    "z = 2975934\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### float\n",
    "Float, or \"floating point number\" is a positive or negative number containing one or more decimals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Floats:\n",
    "```\n",
    "x = 2.6\n",
    "y = -8.702\n",
    "z = 3.1415926\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### complex\n",
    "Complex numbers are written with a \"j\" as the imaginary part, equivalent to \"i\" in math.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex: \n",
    "```\n",
    "x = 3+5j\n",
    "y = -2+7j\n",
    "z = -j\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Text Types**\n",
    "#### str\n",
    "The text type used in Python is called a string. String is a collection of alphabets, words, or characters. In Python, strings are either surrounded by single quotation marks (' ') or double quotation marks (\" \"). For example, 'hello' is exactly the same as \"hello\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assign String to a Variable\n",
    "Assigning a string to a variable is done with the variable name followed by an equal sign and the string:\n",
    "```\n",
    "a = \"Hello\"\n",
    "print(a)\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Multiline Strings\n",
    "You can assign a multiline string to a variable by using three quotes:\n",
    "```\n",
    "a = \"\"\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,\n",
    "consectetur adipiscing elit,\n",
    "sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt\n",
    "ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.\"\"\"\n",
    "print(a)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Boolean**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### True or false\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming you often need to know if an expression is ***True*** or ***False***.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can evaluate any expression in Python, and get one of two answers, True or False.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you compare two values, the expression is evaluated and Python returns the Boolean answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Evaluate Values and Variables\n",
    "The *bool()* function allows you to evaluate any value, and give you True or False in return,\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(bool(\"Hello\"))\n",
    "print(bool(15))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "x = \"Hello\"\n",
    "y = 15\n",
    "print(bool(x))\n",
    "print(bool(y))\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### True or False?\n",
    "\n",
    "**True**\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost any value is evaluated to True if it has some sort of content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any string is True, except empty strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any number is True, except 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "**False**\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, there are not many values that evaluate to False, except empty \n",
    "values, such as \" \", the number 0, and the value None. And of course the value False evaluates to False.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **What is casting?**\n",
    "Type Casting is the method to convert the variable data type into a certain data type in order to the operation required to be performed by users\n",
    "\n",
    "Mainly in type casting can be done with these data type function:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Int() : Int() function take float or string as an argument and return int type object.\n",
    "- float() : float() function take int or string as an argument and return float type object.\n",
    "- str() : str() function take float or int as an argument and return string type object.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "Integers:\n",
    "```\n",
    "x = int(1)   # x will be 1\n",
    "y = int(2.8) # y will be 2\n",
    "z = int(\"3\") # z will be 3\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Floats:\n",
    "```\n",
    "x = float(1)     # x will be 1.0\n",
    "y = float(2.8)   # y will be 2.8\n",
    "z = float(\"3\")   # z will be 3.0\n",
    "w = float(\"4.2\") # w will be 4.2\n",
    "```\n",
    "Strings:\n",
    "```\n",
    "x = str(\"s1\") # x will be 's1'\n",
    "y = str(2)    # y will be '2'\n",
    "z = str(3.0)  # z will be '3.0'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## **What are operators?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Arithmetic Operators\n",
    "Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Operator | Name | Description | \n",
    "| -------- | ---- | ----------- |\n",
    "| x + y | Addition | Sum of values x and y |\n",
    "| x - y | Subtraction | Difference of the values x and y |\n",
    "| x * y | Multiplication | Product of the values x and y | \n",
    "| x / y | Division | Quotient of the values x and y |\n",
    "| x % y | Modulus | Remainder of x divided by y |\n",
    "| x ** y | Exponentation | x to the power of y |\n",
    "| x // y | Floor division | The largest possible integer that is less than or equal to the quotient of x and y |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison Operators\n",
    "Comparison operators are used to compare two values:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Operators | Description |\n",
    "| --------- | -------------- |\n",
    "| a == b | a equal to b |\n",
    "| a != b | a not equal to b |\n",
    "| a < b | a less than b |\n",
    "| a > b | a greater than b |\n",
    "| a <= b | a less than or equal to b |\n",
    "| a >= b | a greater than or equal to b |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logical Operators\n",
    "Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Operators | Description |\n",
    "| --------- | -------------- |\n",
    "| and | Returns True if both statements are true |\n",
    "| or | Returns True if one of the statements is true |\n",
    "| not | Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true |\n",
